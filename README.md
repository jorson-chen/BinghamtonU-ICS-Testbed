# BinghamtonU-ICS-Testbed
Set of ICS Testbed network captures during programming, system startup, and system operation.

This repository contains a collection of industrial control system (ICS) network captures for the ICS testbed at Binghamton University. The various devices and their network connections are portrayed in the image file, BU_ICS_TestbedLayout. The testbed emulates a power generation plant and is described in detail in the paper:

E. Korkmaz, A. Dolgikh, M. Davis, V. Skormin. “Industrial Control Systems Security Testbed”, Annual Symposium on Information Assurance, 2016.

When referring to these network data captures in research works, we ask that you please cite the paper:

Description of pcap Contents: All files are created by capturing all ControlLogix PLC traffic and RSLinx traffic on the switch. 

DevicePluggedIn_RunSequenceStartStop - 
This file contains the network capture showing the various devices connecting to the industrial network one by one. Then the  system operations are started and run for a few minutes before the system operations are stopped.

ProgramPLC - 
This file contains a network capture of the programming station programming the PLC with ladder logic.

RSLinx_BrowseNetworkDevices -
Network capture of RSLinx searching network for devices and information about devices.
